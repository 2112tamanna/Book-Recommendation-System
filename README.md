# Book Recommendation System

## Introduction
 With an increasing amount of information on the internet and a considerable increase in the number of users, it is essential for companies to search, map, and offer relevant information based on the preferences of users. Aan important functional means of providing personalized service to users is Recommendation System. This system uses algorithms and data analysis techniques to suggest items,content, or services that should be of interest to customers based on their past choices or by analyzing the preferences of similar users. Companies like Netflix, Amazon, etc. use recommender systems to help their users to identify the correct product or content for them.

ðŸŽ¯ The main objective of this project is to create a Book recommendation system that best predicts user interests and recommend the suitable/appropriate books to them ,using various approaches.

## Project Overview
The approaches used in this project are:

Popularity Based recommendation system
It is a type of recommendation system that bases choices on factors like popularity and/or current trends. These systems determine which item (in this case,books) are in the trending list or are the most well-liked by users and then directly recommend them.

Weighted average rating approach
Country-wise approach
Author-wise approach
Collaborative Filitering Based recommendation system
The Collaborative Filtering approach first investigates the userâ€™s behaviors, interests, and searches for similar users. It recommends items to users based on the ratings of similar users on various items and by predicting the missing ratings of the items .

Here Cosine Similarity is used for prediction.
